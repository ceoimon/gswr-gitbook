去使应用的状态产生变化。\n\n这里好像有个矛盾：一方面我们不能去修改状态树，另一方面我们又要通过触发动作去使状态产生变化。我们用个比喻来了解 “修改状态本身\" 和 “改变状态” 这两个概念的差别。比如说你想为你的屋子换个水龙头，“修改状态本身” 就直接把这个屋子的水龙头换掉了。而 “改变状态” 就好像你重新盖个除了水龙头和之前一模一样的屋子，然后把门牌号码换到新的屋子。后面这种做法相当土豪，你可以同时拥有之前和现在的屋子。action描述状态变化的对象\n\naction 对象必须要有 type 这个属性\n通常 type 属性是个字符串\n\n\n下面这个 action 的形容一个递增的变化：{\n   type: 'INCREMENT'\n}\n下面这个 action 的形容一个设定计数器为 100 的变化：{\n   type: 'SET_COUNTER'\n   value: 100,\n}\n例子 1 - 计数器\n演示：https://jsbin.com/tutoxim/edit?console,output这个简单的计数器里只有两种动作。每个动作都有 type 属性用来描述动作。\"INCREMENT\" 计数器自增\n\n\"DECREMENT\" 计数器自减\n\n\n不需要其他额外信息就足够描述动作。\n\n所有动作都可以打印到控制台。\n例子 2 - 多个独立的计数器\n演示：https://jsbin.com/topexiy/edit?console,output添加了两种新的动作每种动作都有 type 属性用来描述动作。\"ADD_COUNTER\" 添加计数器\n\n\"REMOVE_COUNTER\" 移除计数器\n\n\n这两种动作无需提供除了 type 外的其他信息。\n\n为\"INCREMENT\"和\"DECREMENT\"动作添加额外的信息只用 type 已经无法准确描述动作。\n\nindex 用于指定哪个计数器发生变化。\n\n不同计数器不会相互影响。\n\n\n例子 3 - Todo

计数器\n演示：https://jsbin.com/libubul/edit?console,output每次状态变化都可以观察到三个过程\n上一个状态\n\n触发的动作\n\n下一个状态\n\n\n例子 2 - 多个独立的计数器\n演示：https://jsbin.com/zajuma/edit?console,output变化可以是整体的: 增加或删除一个计数器\n\n也可以是部分的: 让单个计数器自增或自减\n\n例子 3 - Todo 应用演示：https://jsbin.com/joqiwu/edit?console,output虽然应用每次更改得到的状态都是全新的状态对象，但是在性能上不必太担心。因为每次构建新的状态时，都可能可以保留对内部一些部分的引用。比如更改了过滤条件需要构建新的状态对象，但是仍然可以保留对之前 todos 数组的引用：上图红色框部分的数据都是共享的，没有浪费。总结/**\n * reducer: (state, action) => nextState\n * 用于计算新的应用状态的纯函数\n *\n */\n\n// 示例\nfunction counter(state, action) {\n  // 用 action 计算出下一个状态\n  switch(action.type) {\n

reducer 函数","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/yefimay/edit?js,console为计数器编写简单的 reducer 函数function counter(state, action) {\n  return state;\n}\n现在我们先不实现里面的功能。因为我们要用到测试驱动的开发方式。测试驱动的开发所谓测试驱动的开发就是你先写好测试，规定了函数的功能和预期效果，然后再去编写逻辑代码实现对应功能。这里我们要使用的是 Expect 库，语法十分简单：// 我们期待当这个函数接受当前状态为 0 和一个 'INCREMENT' 动作之后，它会返回 1.\nexpect(\n  counter(0, { type: 'INCREMENT' })\n).toEqual(1);\n现在让我们编写一些测试用例来规定 reducer 的行为：function counter(state, action) {\n  return state;\n}\n\nexpect(\n  counter(0, { type: 'INCREMENT' })\n).toEqual(1);\n\nexpect(\n  counter(1, { type: 'INCREMENT' })\n).toEqual(2);\n\nexpect(\n  counter(2, { type: 'DECREMENT' })\n).toEqual(1);\n\nexpect(\n  counter(1, { type: 'DECREMENT' })\n).toEqual(0);\n\n// 最后我们加上测试通过的标识\nconsole.log('测试通过！');\n注意在最后我们加上了打印“测试通过”。运行一下试试？这时候运行代码当然会出现错误，因为我们还没实现 reducer.实现代码：function counter(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {\n    return state + 1;\n  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {\n    return state - 1;\n  }\n}\n通过判断 action 的 type 属性去生成不同的状态再运行测试：通过测试！边缘情况处理现在我们需要考虑更边缘的情况：/**\n *...之前写的测试代码\n */\n\n// 如果我们触发的是一个 reducer 不能理解的动作, 它应该直接返回当前状态：\nexpect(\n  counter(1, { type: 'SOMETHING_ELSE' })\n).toEqual(1);\n\nconsole.log('测试通过！');\n运行新写的测试：测试再一次失败了,因为我们没有处理这种情况。修复：function counter(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {\n    return state + 1;\n  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {\n    return state - 1;\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n稍作修改即可。另外一个问题是，如果应用还未初始化，我们应该让它返回初始状态：/**\n *...之前写的测试代码\n */\n\n// 如果状态从未被初始化，我们应该让它返回规定的初始状态。\nexpect(\n  counter(undefined, {})\n).toEqual(0);\n\nconsole.log('测试通过！');\n我们还未处理这种情况修改：function counter(state, action) {\n  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    return 0;\n  }\n  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {\n    return state + 1;\n  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {\n    return state - 1;\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n通过检查 state 参数是不是 undefined 就可以判断是否已经初始化。使用 ES6 简化代码我们的功能已经实现好了，但是代码的结构十分原始。我们可以使用 ES6 对代码进行美化:// 1.使用 ES6 箭头函数语法。\n// 2.使用 ES6 默认参数语法替代条件判断。\nconst counter = (state = 0, action) => {\n  // 3.使用 switch 代替连续的 if else.\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1;\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n这样我们就实现了一个完整的计数器 reducer 了。总结我们从头实现了一个完整功能的 reducer, 可以看到，并不复杂，有一些值得注意的是：reducer 在接受到无法处理的动作时应该直接返回当前的状态。\n\nreducer 在接受未初始化的状态时应该使用初始状态。\n\n思考： （答案将在下一节公布）多个独立计数器的 reducer 要怎么写？ \n\n上节解答:使用纯函数去计算状态到底有啥好处？\n简化应用逻辑。纯函数本身无需依赖其他代码逻辑。\n\n容易测试，可复现状态。由于纯函数不依赖外部环境，容易观察和再创建。\n\n可记录。由于状态只依赖于参数的输入，我们可以很容易记录下状态方便以后使用。\n这些都是实现应用“时间旅行” (time travel) 和“热重载” (hot reloading)的前提。\n\n\n扩展阅读：测试驱动开发（百度百科）\n\n测试驱动开发（维基百科）\n\n.markdown-section\n{\n    overflow: visible;\n}\n.promo {\n    opacity: 0;\n  z-index: 0;\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display: -moz-box;\n

作为全局变量。\n\n如果你想了解什么是 UMD，可以查看这篇博文: 神马是AMD, CommonJS, UMD?概念Redux 使用一个中心储存器(store)来管理应用状态。\n\n通过分发 (dispatch) 来触发动作。\n\n通过订阅 (subscribe) 来监听状态变化。\n\nstore:Redux 三大原则结合的体现。\n\n储存并控制着应用状态。\n\n宇宙的中心在 Redux 应用里，宇宙的中心就是 store, 它保存着所有的状态，控制着所有的状态变化。让我们来创建一个 store:const { createStore } = Redux; // ES6 结构语法\n// var createStore = Redux.createStore; // 等同于上面的代码\n// import { createStore } from 'redux'; // 模块化语法，等同于上面的代码。\nconst store = createStore(counter);\ncreateStore 方法用于创建一个 store, 它接受一个 reducer 作为参数，指定使用这个 reducer 处理应用状态。获取应用状态 getState()创建 store 之后，可以使用 getState 方法来获取应用当前的状态。console.log(store.getState()); // 打印目前状态\n分发一个动作 dispatch()我们可以通过分发一个动作来改变状态。console.log(store.getState());\n\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }); // 分发一个动作，让 reducer 去处理。\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // 打印新的状态\ndispatch 方法用于分发一个动作给 reducer 去计算出新的状态。通知变化 subscribe()虽然我们可以打印出状态，但在实际应用中往往是视图元素在使用这些状态，我们必须通知它们状态的改变。使用 subscribe 方法可以将指定函数在状态变化后立即触发：const render = () => {\n  document.body.innerText = store.getState();\n}\n\nstore.subscribe(render); //在状态发生变化后执行 render.\nrender(); // 渲染出初始状态。\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });\n});\n我们定义了一个 render 方法，将当前状态显示在页面上。（在 output 面板）并在页面中绑定了点击事件，每一次点击页面都会分发一个计数器自增动作。通过使用 subscribe 方法，我们可以在状态变化后立即渲染出最新的变化。这样，我们就完成了第一个完整的 Redux 应用了！总结store 管理着 Redux 应用的所有状态。通过 createStore(reducer) 创建。需要指定用于处理状态的 reducer.\n\n\n保存着当前的状态。getState() 获取状态。\n\n\n管理状态变化。dispatch(action) 分发一个动作给 reducer 去计算新状态。\n\n\n通知变化。subscribe(Function) 让函数在状态变化后执行。\n\n\n\n一个完整的 Redux

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/nepobom/edit?js,console,output在前面一节中，我们使用 Redux 实现了一个完整的计数器应用。我们使用 store 去管理状态：getState()\n\ndispatch(action)\n\nsubscribe(Function)\n\n通过 store 我们可以获取状态，分发动作，绑定通知。所以这个神奇的 store 里面到底是怎样的呢？揭开引擎盖让我们开始重新实现一次 createStore.我们已经知道，最终返回的 store 对象存在如下的方法：getState\n\ndispatch\n\nsubscribe\n\n我们可以猜测大概的实现是这样的：const createStore = (reducer) => {\n  let state; // 用于保存最新的应用状态。\n\n  const getState = () => state; // 直接返回最新状态。\n\n  const dispatch = (action) => {\n    // ...把 action 交给 reducer 处理。\n  }\n\n  const subscribe = (listener) => {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe } // 返回一个 store 对象.\n}\n实现 subscribe()subscribe 方法用于将一个函数绑定到 store 上，当状态改变，就执行这个函数。\n\n我们称绑定的函数为订阅者 (listener)\n\n可以有多个订阅者同时订阅 store\n\n为了实现通知多个订阅者，我们需要维护一个订阅者队列。const createStore = (reducer) => {\n  let state; // 用于保存最新的应用状态。\n  let listeners = []; // 保存订阅者。\n\n  const getState = () => state; // 直接返回最新状态。\n\n  const dispatch = (action) => {\n    // ...把 action 交给 reducer 处理。\n  }\n\n  const subscribe = (listener) => {\n    listeners.push(listener); // 将订阅者保存起来。\n  }\n\n  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe } // 返回一个 store 对象.\n}\nsubscribe 方法并不用于通知（调用）订阅者们，因为它甚至不知道状态的变化。状态的变化发生在分发动作里面。实现 dispatch()应用状态的改变流程：\n1. store 将动作分发给 reducer\n2. reducer 计算新的状态\n3. store 将新的状态保存起来\n4. store 通知订阅者们我们可以把这一系列的动作合起来实现：const createStore = (reducer) => {\n  let state; // 用于保存最新的应用状态。\n  let listeners = []; // 保存订阅者。\n\n  const getState = () => state; // 直接返回最新状态。\n\n  const dispatch = (action) => {\n    state = reducer(state, action); // 计算新状态并保存。\n    listeners.forEach(listener = listener()); // 通知（调用）订阅者。\n  };\n\n  const subscribe = (listener) => {\n    listeners.push(listener); // 将订阅者保存起来。\n  };\n\n  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe }; // 返回一个 store 对象.\n}\n到这里我们似乎已经完成了整个 store 的构造过程，但是等等，我们没有给订阅者退订的机会...这不是霸王条约吗？我们可以通过这样的方法来添加退订功能：const subscribe = (listener) => {\n  listeners.push(listener); // 将订阅者保存起来。\n\n  // 返回一个具有退订功能的函数\n  return () => {\n    listeners = listeners.filter(l => l != listener);\n  };\n};\n然后我们可以这样调用它：const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(doSomething); // 添加订阅\nunsubscribe(); // 退订\n最后，我们还要记得初始化应用的状态:const createStore = (reducer) => {\n  let state; // 用于保存最新的应用状态。\n  let listeners = []; // 保存订阅者。\n\n  const getState = () => state; // 直接返回最新状态。\n\n  const dispatch = (action) => {\n    state = reducer(state, action); // 计算新状态并保存。\n    listeners.forEach(listener = listener()); // 通知（调用）订阅者。\n  };\n\n  const subscribe = (listener) => {\n    listeners.push(listener); // 将订阅者保存起来。\n\n    // 返回一个具有退订功能的函数\n    return () => {\n      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l != listener);\n    };\n  };\n\n  dispatch({}); // 初始化应用状态\n\n  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe }; // 返回一个 store 对象.\n}\n这样我们就实现了一个 createStore 方法，并且了解了 store 的内部原理了。值得一提的是，这个简单的方法其实就跟最初的官方实现差不了多少～总结store 内部并不复杂\n\n思考： （答案将在下一节公布）如果不在 subscribe 方法返回退订函数，可能会有什么麻烦？\n\n上节解答:为什么需要 store 去分发动作给 reducer 而不是直接调用 reducer?\n确保每次调用 reducer 传进入的状态都是最新的。\n\n可以避免动作之间的竞争情况。\n\n更易于测试。\n\n\n扩展阅读：1.0 版本 Redux 的createStore\n\n.markdown-section\n{\n

版本的 React 和 React-DOM，会将 React, ReactDOM 作为全局变量。使用 ReactReact 是一个视图层框架。如果你没有接触过 React, 你可以前往 http://sike.io/react 学习。让我们来把 render 方法用 React 改写:const render = () => {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    ,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n}\n我们不再把数字直接渲染到页面里，而是渲染一个 Counter 组件，这个组件接受应用当前状态作为 value 属性。const Counter = ({value}) => (\n  {value}\n)\n我们只需要直接将传进入的数值用最大的标题渲染出来。现在应用应该也可以正常执行。现在我想为计数器加上两个按钮，分别用于自增和自减。而不是单纯地增加。const Counter = ({\n  value,\n  onIncrement,\n  onDecrement\n}) => (\n  \n  {value}\n  +\n  -\n  \n);\n\nconst render = () => {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    \n        store.dispatch({\n          type: 'INCREMENT'           \n        })            \n      }\n      onDecrement={() =>\n        store.dispatch({\n          type: 'DECREMENT'\n        })            \n      }\n    />,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n};\n通过添加 onClick 事件并在里面分发动作，我们可以做到改变应用目前的状态。还要记得把最下面的页面点击事件去掉～总结在 React 中，很容易使用 Redux.通过给视图添加分发动作的事件来改变状态\n\n通过订阅渲染函数让每次状态改变触发渲染\n\n思考： （答案将在下一节公布）为什么我们不在 Counter 组件里面直接获取当前状态？\n\n上节解答:如果不在 subscribe 方法返回退订函数，可能会有什么麻烦？\n不提供退订功能可能出现的情况：当订阅者引用了一个后来被移除的页面元素时，由于每次状态变化都会调用所有订阅者，这时订阅者会试图获取一个不存在的元素并进行操作而出现错误。\n\n即使你很谨慎，不让订阅者出现引用错误，订阅者的数量一直在增加，也可能导致应用反应缓慢。如果为 store 提供一个额外的 unsubscribe 函数：你需要合适地标记订阅者，导致逻辑变得复杂。"},"avoiding-array-mutations-with-concat-slice-and-spread.html":{"url":"avoiding-array-mutations-with-concat-slice-and-spread.html","title":"9. 使用 slice()，concat() 和 ...(展开运算符) 来避免修改数组","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/kaboqe/edit?js,console环境引入了 Expect, deep-freeze 库。\n\nExpect 我们之前已经用过, 而 deep-freeze 库只提供了一个方法 deepFreeze.deepFreeze冻结对象，让整个对象不可修改。还记得之前使用过的测试驱开发？本节也将使用这个方法。可变和不可变我们已经知道，在 Redux 中, state 是只读的，每次要改变只能去计算出一个全新的。像这种不可修改的对象叫做不可变 (immutable) 对象。将修改对象称为转变 (mutation).为了避免无意地转变不可变对象，我们将讨论一些在处理不可变数组时，应该要注意的地方。多个计数器例子我们之前已经实现过单个计数器，并使用单个数值表示整个应用的状态。当我们要写一个\"多个独立计数器\"应用时（相信你已经玩弄过前面的示例）, 我们要用数组去表示多个单独的计数器状态。添加计数器我想实现的第一个函数是添加计数器的函数const addCounter = (list) => {\n  // 待实现\n};\n\nconst testAddCounter = () => {\n  const listBefore = [];\n  const listAfter = [0];\n  expect(\n    addCounter(listBefore)\n  ).toEqual(listAfter);\n};\n\ntestAddCounter();\nconsole.log('全部测试通过！');\n我们希望在执行 addCounter 后给数组最后添加一个 0我们可以简单地使用 push 方法将 0 加入数组，而且可以通过测试。const addCounter = (list) => {\n  list.push(0);\n  return list;\n};\n！Tests passed screenshot当然，我们要确保我们没有转变这个数组。通过 deepFreeze 方法我们可以保护数组不被修改：deepFreeze(listBefore);\n现在，再次运行代码，会报错误，因为不能添加新的属性到一个被“冰冻”的对象。我将使用数组的 concat 方法，这个方法不会修改原来的数组，而是返回一个新的数组，它是一个纯函数const addCounter = (list) => {\n  return list.concat([0]);\n};\n测试再一次通过，因为我们没有转变原来的状态。我们也可以使用 ES6 数组 ...(展开运算符) 来简化代码：const addCounter = (list) => {\n  return [...list, 0];\n};\n移除计数器下面要实现的是 removeCounter, 用于移除计数器。它接受两个参数，一个是数值数组（代表所有计数器的状态）,另一个是代表计数器位置的索引 (index).const removeCounter = (list, index) => {\n\n};\n\nconst testRemoveCounter = () => {\n  const listBefore = [0, 10, 20];\n  const listAfter = [0, 20];\n\n  deepFreeze(listBefore); // 我们直接添加了 deepFreeze.\n\n  expect(\n    removeCounter(listBefore, 1)\n  ).toEqual(listAfter);\n};\n如果现在的状态是三个计数器，在调用删除计数器的函数后，我们会删除对应索引的计数器，这里是第二个。（索引为1）一般来说，我们可以使用 splice 方法去删除数组里面的东西。但是， splice 是一个转变方法，它会修改原有的数组，我们不应该在 Redux 中使用。const removeCounter = (list, index) => {\n  list.splice(index, 1);\n  return list;\n};\n在使用 deepFreeze 之后这样是通过不了的，我们要想出另外一个删除数组项的办法。我们可以使用一个跟 splice 很像的 slice 方法，但是它跟 splice 不一样，每次调用都会返回一个新的数组。所以我们可以这么用：// ES5\nfunction removeCounter(list, index) {\n  return list.slice(0, index).concat(list.slice(index + 1));\n}\n\n// ES6 展开运算符\nconst removeCounter = (list, index) => {\n  return [\n    ...list.slice(0, index),\n    ...list.slice(index + 1)\n  ];\n};\n我们只要数组的指定索引前和后的部分。计数器自增计数器自增应该是这样的：const incrementCounter = (list, index) => {\n\n};\n\nconst testIncrementCounter = () => {\n  const listBefore = [0, 10, 20];\n  const listAfter = [0, 11, 20];\n\n  deepFreeze(listBefore); // 我们直接添加了 deepFreeze.\n\n  expect(\n    incrementCounter(listBefore, 1)\n  ).toEqual(listAfter)\n};\n最直接的方法是直接修改数组对应索引的项，但这也是会使数组发生转变的，因为我们使用了 deepFreeze, 它不会通过测试。const incrementCounter = (list, index) => {\n  list[index]++;\n  return list;\n};\n为了解决这个问题，我们同样可以使用 slice 和 concat 来拼接新的数组，使用展开运算符取代 concat 将更直观简洁。// ES5\nfunction incrementCounter(list,

...(展开运算符) 来避免修改对象","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/kaboqe/edit?js,console标记 Todo 为完成/代办和上一节一样，我们将使用 expect 和 deepFreeze 来编写一些非转变函数。这次，要测试的是一个叫 toggleTodo 的方法，它用于改变 todo 对象里的 completed 属性，如果一个 todo 是标记为完成的，它将是 true, 否则为 false.const toggleTodo = (todo) => {\n\n};\n\nconst testToggleTodo = () => {\n  const todoBefore = {\n    id: 0,\n    text: 'Learn Redux',\n    completed: false\n  };\n  const todoAfter = {\n    id: 0,\n    text: 'Learn Redux',\n    completed: true\n  };\n\n  expect(\n    toggleTodo(todoBefore)\n  ).toEqual(todoAfter);\n};\n\ntestToggleTodo();\nconsole.log('全部测试通过！');\n我们可以直接“反转”目前的值来达到目地，就像上一节，我们首先写一个转变版本的来通过测试。const toggleTodo = (todo) => {\n  todo.completed = !todo.completed;\n  return todo;\n};\n我只是单纯地“反转”了 completed 属性的值，然后重新赋值。虽然通过了测试，但是我们已经知道这样的转变是（在 Redux 中）不被允许的。我们可以通过使用 deepFreeze 来保护我们的对象。deepFreeze(todoBefore); // 将这行代码放到 expect 前\n既然我们不能修改原有的对象，我们就要新建一个对象，并将之前的对象完全复制一次，然后再去修改需要改变的属性。const toggleTodo = (todo) => {\n  const newObject = {\n    id: todo.id,\n    text: todo.text,\n    completed: !todo.completed\n  };\n  return newObject;\n};\n这虽然是一个可行的办法，但是有时可能会忘记填入一些其他的属性，特别是当对象变得越来越复杂。所以我们可以使用在 ES6 里的新增的 Object.assign 方法，它可以将传进入的任意多个对象组合为一个对象，注意它会修改第一个传入的对象，所以我们一般要这么使用：const toggleTodo = (todo) => {\n  return Object.assign({}, todo, {\n    completed: !todo.completed\n  });\n};\n我们传进入的第一个对象是一个空的对象，这样就确保了每次返回的都是新建的对象。其他随后的对象参数都会按顺序地跟目前得到的对象进行“合并”，将所有属性复制到目前的对象中，如果遇到同名的属性将进行覆盖，所以遇到同名的属性，总是会取最后出现的那一个。另外值得一提的是，在 ES7 的提议中，对象也是可以使用展开运算符 (...) 的。const toggleTodo = (todo) => {\n  return {\n    ...todo,\n    completed: !todo.completed\n  };\n};\n这样会更简洁明了。总结避免使用会使原来对象发生转变的方法。使用 deepFreeze 保护对象不被修改。\n\n\n常见的转变方法及替代方法：\nlet object = { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2', key3: 'value3' };\nlet newObject = {};\n\n// 转变方法\nnewObject = object;\nnewObject.key3 = 'newValue';\nconsole.log(newObject); // Object {key1: \"value1\", key2: \"value2\", key3:

Object.assign({}, object, { key3: 'newValue' }); // ES6\nnewObject = { ...object, key3: 'newValue' }; // ES7\nconsole.log(newObject); // Object {key1: \"value1\", key2: \"value2\", key3: \"newValue\"}\nconsole.log(object); // Object {key1: \"value1\", key2: \"value2\", key3: \"value3\"}\n思考： （答案将在下一节公布）上节解答:deepFreeze 的原理是什么，它是怎么保护对象的？\nObject 存在一个 freeze 方法，它的作用是让目标对象不能添加、修改和删除属性，换言之就是使对象变得不可变 (immutable).\n\ndeepFreeze 实现：function deepFreeze (obj) {\n  Object.freeze(obj);\n\n  Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (prop) {\n    if

应用的“状态计算器” (reducer).不同的是我们这次将加入 deepFreeze 来保护应用状态不被修改。添加 todo我们首先要写的是处理添加 todo 的逻辑。todo 应该被包含在一个数组里面。每一个 todo 都有标号和内容，以及它们的完成状态，默认是未完成的。const todos = (state = [], action) => {\n\n};\n\nconst testAddTodo = () => {\n  const stateBefore = [];\n  const action = {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    id: 0,\n    text: 'Learn Redux'\n  };\n  const stateAfter = [\n    {\n      id: 0,\n      text: 'Learn Redux',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ];\n};\n为了确保 reducer 是纯函数，我们将使用 deepFreeze 来 “冰冻” stateBefore 和 action.const testAddTodo = () => {\n  //...\n  deepFreeze(stateBefore);\n  deepFreeze(action);\n  expect(\n    todos(stateBefore, action)\n  ).toEqual(stateAfter);\n};\n接下来就可以开始实现 reducer 对应的添加 todo 功能了。const todos = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n

todo 完成状态的功能。切换 todo 完成状态编写测试函数来规范功能：const testToggleTodo = () => {\n  const stateBefore = [\n    {\n      id: 0,\n      text: 'Learn Redux',\n      completed: false\n    },\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      text: 'Go shopping',\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ];\n  const action = {\n    type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',\n    id: 1\n  };\n  const stateAfter = [\n    {\n      id: 0,\n      text: 'Learn Redux',\n      completed: false\n    },\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      text: 'Go shopping',\n      completed: true\n    }\n  ];\n\n  deepFreeze(stateBefore);\n  deepFreeze(action);\n\n  expect(\n    todos(stateBefore, action)\n  ).toEqual(stateAfter);\n};\n就像之前一样，使用了 deepFreeze 来确保状态不被修改。然后我们来实现这个 reducer 的对应功能：const todos = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    // ...case 'ADD_TODO'\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.map(todo => {\n        if (todo.id !== action.id) {\n          return todo;\n        }\n\n        return {\n          ...todo,\n          completed: !todo.completed\n        };\n      });\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n通过使用 map 方法去计算新的数组, 只对对应 id 的 todo 作修改。（注意使用非转变方法）通过测试：testAddTodo();\ntestToggleTodo();\nconsole.log('测试通过！');\n这样我们就实现了一个可以处理添加 todo 和切换 todo 完成状态的 reducer.总结要使用非转变方法去计算新的数组。\n\n计算对象时，切忌直接修改对象属性。\n\n.markdown-section\n{\n

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/makahu/edit?js,console环境包含上节写的 todo 应用 reducer 和测试代码\n\n多个 reducer我们已经为两个不同应用分别写过两个 reducer.在实际应用中，将所有状态计算都放到一个 reducer, 会让它越来越臃肿复杂，难以维护。我们可以尝试将 reducer “拆解”成为多个 reducer, 并让它们各司其职。拆解 todo 应用的 reducer首先分析一下我们之前写的 todo 应用 reducer. 它可以处理 ADD_TODO 和 TOGGLE_TODO 动作， 前者用于添加一个 todo, 后者则是更新指定一个 todo 的状态。如果我们把 todos 和 todo 的状态分开解释会更容易理解：todosADD_TODO: 添加一个新的 todo 到列表。\n\n\ntodoTOGGLE_TODO: 切换这个 todo 的完成状态。\n\n\n所以 todos 和 todo 是存在包含关系的一组状态，但是我们现在把这些状态都放到一起了，这样会导致关系层次难以理解。我们可以尝试将 todo 分离出来，单独为它的状态写一个 reducer.const todo = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return {\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n      };\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      if (state.id !== action.id) {\n        return state;\n      }\n\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        completed: !state.completed\n      };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n注意在 todo reducer 里我们也处理了 ADD_TODO 动作，并返回了一个新的 todo.这样做能让 todos reducer 更专注于 todos 列表本身：const todos = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        todo(undefined, action) // 计算一个新的 todo\n      ];\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.map(t => todo(t, action)); // 计算每一个 todo 的完成状态\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n注意：我们没有修改 action, 而是直接传递 action.\n\ntodo reducer 处理的只是整个应用状态的一部分, 不需要有初始化值。\n\n其实这样的模式 (pattern) 在 Redux 开发中很常见，它被称作 ” reducer 组合“ (reducer composition).总结reducer 组合处理包含关系的状态\n一个最上层的父 reducer 管理着整体状态。\n\n各个子 reducer 负责状态的不同部分。\n\n父 reducer 通过调用子 reducer 来计算包含的状态。\n传递 action\n\n\n\n.markdown-section\n{\n    overflow: visible;\n}\n.promo {\n    opacity: 0;\n  z-index: 0;\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display:

库。\n\n模拟分发了一些动作。\n\n添加了一些打印消息。\n\n添加 todos 过滤器状态信息我们模拟了一些分发动作的情况，并将当前的状态打印出来。目前这个 todo 应用的 reducer 已经可以处理必要的动作了。我们也只用到了一个数组来代表整个应用的状态。但是如果我们想要应用储存更多的状态信息呢？比如我们想要添加一个让用户选择当前可见的 todo 列表的过滤器。这个过滤器应该有如下选择：\"SHOW_ALL\": 显示全部 todos, 默认值。\n\n\"SHOW_ACTIVE\": 显示未完成的 todos.\n\n\"SHOW_COMPLETED\": 显示完成的 todos.\n\n我们可以把它命名为 visibilityFilter.const visibilityFilter = (\n  state = 'SHOW_ALL',\n  action\n) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':\n      return action.filter;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n过滤器的状态只是一串代表着当前过滤器的字符串，它会被 \"SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER\" 动作改变。我们暂不实现过滤的功能，仅仅是考虑新的状态信息的存放。过滤器与 todos 不是包含关系，因此可以把它们放到同一层。可以运用上一节的 “ reducer 组合”模式，创建一个更大的父 reducer 来处理整体应用状态：const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {\n  return {\n    todos: todos(\n      state.todos,\n      action\n    ),\n    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(\n      state.visibilityFilter,\n      action\n    )\n  };\n};\ntodoApp 通过调用其他 reducer 去计算不同部分的状态，并将其组合成一个单一的状态对象。这样我们的 todo 应用的状态就不再是一个数组，而是对象。我们通过使用 “ reducer 组合” 来让应用可以在不修改原有 reducer 的基础上添加额外的 reducer.我们还需要修改 createStore 传入的 reducer:const store = createStore(todoApp);\n对于每次传入的 state 和 action, 各个 reducer 都是独立处理同一个动作，计算不同部分的状态的，它们互不干扰。我们可以添加下面的代码来测试我们新写的 reducer:console.log('Dispatching SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER.');\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n  filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'\n});\nconsole.log('Current state:');\nconsole.log(store.getState());\nconsole.log('--------------');\n可以看到，当分发 \"SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER\" 动作时，不会影响到 todos 的状态，但是 visibilityFilter 的状态更新了。总结使用 “reducer 组合” 扩展应用：\n使用一个抽象 reducer 包含所有 reducer 并用于创建应用 store.\n\n不同 reducer 可以处理相对独立的应用状态部分。\n\n对于被分发的每个动作，每一个 reducer 分别处理，互不干扰。\n\n\n思考： （答案将在下一节公布）把 visibilityFilter 包含到 todos 里面会有什么问题？\n\n.markdown-section\n{\n    overflow: visible;\n}\n.promo {\n    opacity: 0;\n  z-index: 0;\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display: -moz-box;\n  display: -webkit-flex;\n  display:

combineReducers() 实现 Reducer组合","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/zeyovaq/edit?js,console环境包含上节的内容。\n\n概念combineReducers用于组合多个 reducer.使用 combineReducers上一节中，我们已经知道了如何使用 reducer 组合 来让不同的 reducer 分工合作。在 Redux 应用中， 这样的用法非常普遍，所以 Redux 提供了一个方法让你不用每次都手工编写这些代码。它为了自动生成最高层的 reducer （用于生成应用 store）。这个方法就是 combineReducers, 它接受一个对象，这个对象声明了要组合的不同的 reducer 和其要处理的对应的状态部分名称。// const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {\n//   return {\n//     todos: todos(\n//       state.todos,\n//       action\n//     ),\n//     visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(\n//       state.visibilityFilter,\n//       action\n//     )\n//   };\n// };\nconst { combineReducers } = Redux;\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos: todos,\n  visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter\n});\n基本功能跟我们之前手工写的是一致的，todos reducer 将会处理应用状态里叫 todos 的那个部分, 同理的其他 reducer 也将用于处理对应名称 (keys) 的部分，最后把所有状态组合起来成为应用的整体状态。我们还可以使用 ES6 语法简化代码：const todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter\n});\n总结/**\n * combineReducers: (reducers: { [state key]: reducer }) => topLevelReducer\n * 用于组合多个 reducers\n * 并让每个 reducer 处理对应应用状态的 state key.\n */\n\n// 示例\nconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter\n});\n\nconst initialState = todoApp(undefined, {});\nconsole.log(initialState); // [object Object] { todos: [], visibilityFilter: \"SHOW_ALL\" }\n\nconst addedTodoState = todoApp(initialState, { type: 'ADD_TODO', id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux' });\nconsole.log(addedTodoState); // [object Object] { todos: [[object Object] { completed: false, id: 1, text: \"Learn Redux\" }], visibilityFilter: \"SHOW_ALL\" }\n\nconst changedFilterState = todoApp(addedTodoState, { type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'});\nconsole.log(changedFilterState); // [object Object] { todos: [[object Object] { completed: false, id: 1, text: \"Learn Redux\" }], visibilityFilter: \"SHOW_COMPLETED\" }\n思考： （答案将在下一节公布）上节解答:把 visibilityFilter 包含到 todos 里面会有什么问题？\n使两个相互独立的状态耦合在一起。\n\n增加处理动作的复杂性。\n即使修改过滤器的状态往往会导致 todo 列表的状态变化，过滤器的状态依然是与 todo 列表状态相互独立存在的。它们之间的关联就是触发某些动作时它们都会改变。\n\n\n.markdown-section\n{\n

combineReducers()我们已经知道如何使用 combineReducers 来组合多个 reducer 了，虽然我们之前也已经实现过实现同样功能的函数，但是并不具有一般性。combineReducers 可以组合任意数量的 reducer, 那么它是如何做到的呢？让我们来手动实现一次这个函数，以便加深对其的了解。我们已经知道这个函数的输入与输出是什么：const combineReducers = (reducers) => {\n  return (state = {}, action) => {\n\n  }\n}\n对于传入的 reducers 数组, 函数总是返回一个大的 reducer 函数。让我们回顾一下, reducer 是一个接受当前状态和被分发的动作，计算出新的状态的纯函数。我们的目标是拿到一个由各个 reducer 计算后总的新状态。我们可以调用每个 reducer, 把它们要处理的那部分状态和被分发的动作传入去计算出新的状态。并且这些新状态都是有名字标记的，也就是传入对象的键 (keys).最后把这些新状态组合起来就好了。const combineReducers = (reducers) => {\n  return (state = {}, action) => {\n    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(\n      (nextState, key) => {\n        nextState[key] = reducers[key](\n          state[key],\n          action\n        );\n        return nextState;\n      },\n      {}\n    );\n  };\n};\n使用 reduce 方法能够让计算串联起来得到最终结果。注意我们实际上用转变的方法修改了 nextState, 但因为 nextState 本来是函数内定义的，不会影响 reducer 作为纯函数的特性。总结我们知道了怎么实现 combineReducers 这个帮助函数。但是 combineReducers 不是开发 Redux 应用必须用到的，所以如果你还是不完全明白它是怎么一回事也不是太大的问题。高阶函数高阶函数是指一个函数可以接受其他函数作为参数，也可以是返回一个函数的函数。combineReducers 是一个高阶函数， 它返回了一个函数。高阶函数对开发 Redux 应用有很大的帮助，了解这个概念可以提高你的生产力。.markdown-section\n{\n    overflow:

列表我们之前已经写好了三个 reducer 并通过 combineReducers 将他们组合起来。现在可以尝试实现视图层了。我们将使用 React 实现这个例子。我们把渲染的逻辑放在最下面。const render = () => {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    ,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n};\n\nstore.subscribe(render);\nrender(); // 初始化渲染。\n我们可以使用 ES6 的 class 关键词来创建一个 React 组件，这个组件将渲染出一个 div, 在这个容器内有一个“添加 todo ” 的按钮：const { Component } = React;\n\nlet nextTodoId = 0;\nclass TodoApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n         {\n          store.dispatch({\n            type: 'ADD_TODO',\n            text: 'Test',\n            id: nextTodoId++\n          });\n        }}>\n          添加 Todo\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n注意我们这里直接指定了 (hard-coded) 新建 todo 的 text 属性，它应该由用户填写的，但这里为了保持简单先放着。我们还需要使用惟一的 id 属性去标记不同的 todo. 这里使用了一个全局变量 nextTodoId.当然我们还要渲染出 todo 列表, 假设我们会通过 props 传入 todos 数据：class TodoApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return(\n      \n        {/* ... */}\n        \n          {this.props.todos.map(todo =>\n            \n              {todo.text}\n            \n          )}\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n最后我们需要在渲染的时候传入 todos 作为 TodoApp 的 props.const render = () => {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    \n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n};\n让用户输入 todo现在已经可以做到添加 todo 和显示 todo 列表了，但是我们不能总是添加无意义的 todo. 我们应该让用户输入 todo 的内容。通过使用 React 提供的 ref 组件属性, 我们就可以得到组件的引用并取得其中填入的值：class TodoApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return(\n      \n         {\n          this.input = node;\n        }}/>\n\n         {\n          store.dispatch({\n            type: 'ADD_TODO',\n            text: this.input.value,\n            id: nextTodoId++\n          });\n          this.input.value = '';\n        }}>\n          添加 Todo\n        \n        {/* ... */}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n现在我们可以输入 todo 项了总结就像之前的计数器一样，我们使用了 React 进行页面渲染。整个应用大体是这样的：todoApp reducer: 组合多个 reducertodos reducer: 用于计算 todo 列表的状态。ADD_TODO 动作: 添加一个 todo.\n\nTOGGLE_TODO 动作： 切换 todo 的完成状态。\n\n\nvisibilityFilter reducer: 用于计算过滤器的状态。SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER 动作： 切换过滤器。\n\n\n\nstore: 管理应用的所有状态todoApp 作为参数用作计算状态变化。\n\n\nTodoApp 组件：包裹所有东西输入框：输入 todo 内容使用 ref 属性储存组件引用。\n\n\n“添加 Todo ” 按钮点击事件：获取输入框的值并分发一个 'ADD_TODO' 动作，清空输入框内容。\n\n\ntodo 列表从 props 获取 todos 状态。\n\n用列表渲染每一个 todo.\n\n\n\nrender 方法：渲染 TodoApp 到页面\n从 store 获取 todos 状态\n\n将 todos 状态传入 TodoApp\n\n订阅 store 用于每次状态改变更新视图\n\n\n我们会发现其实整体的结构跟计数器的非常相似。每一部分的分工十分明确。比如“添加 Todo ” 按钮并不知道 todo 具体是怎么添加的，这就是 Redux 带来的好处。.markdown-section\n{\n    overflow: visible;\n}\n.promo {\n    opacity: 0;\n  z-index: 0;\n

React 代办事项列表示例（过滤代办事项）","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n本节使用到的环境：https://jsbin.com/kuhufer/edit?js,output我们已经实现了我们之前所定义的 todos 的动作对应的所有功能，包括添加 todo 和切换 todo 完成状态。添加过滤器在这一节里，我们将实现 SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER 动作对应的功能。通过修改可视过滤器，我们允许用户选择想要看到的 todo 列表，比如已完成的 todos, 未完成的 todos, 或者是全部 todos.我打算直接使用 a 标签来表示切换“按钮”。const FilterLink = ({\n  filter,\n  children\n}) => {\n  return (\n     {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        store.dispatch({\n          type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n          filter\n        });\n       }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    \n  );\n};\n点击这样一个组件将会分发一个 SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER 动作，将可视过滤器切换成传入的 props 的 filter 属性的值所指的过滤器。我们使用字符串来简单地代表过滤器。然后我们在 TodoApp 组件中添加这些过滤器选择组件：class TodoApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return(\n      \n        {/*  */}\n        {/* ... */}\n        {/* ... */}\n        \n          Show:\n          {' '}\n          \n            ALL\n          \n          {' '}\n          \n            Active\n          \n          {' '}\n          \n            Completed\n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n我们现在已经可以点击这些组件并且分发动作了，但是不会有任何的过滤效果，因为我们还没有使用过滤器去过滤 todo 列表。创建一个新的函数用于通过给定过滤器来过滤 todo 列表。它接受两个参数，要过滤的 todo 列表和要使用的过滤器。const getVisibleTodos = (\n  todos,\n  filter\n) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'SHOW_ALL':\n      return todos;\n    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':\n      return todos.filter(\n        t => t.completed\n      );\n    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':\n      return todos.filter(\n        t => !t.completed\n      );\n  }\n};\n使用数组的 filter 方法可以写出非常直观简洁的过滤逻辑。我们使用这个方法来获取当前可见的 todo 列表。class TodoApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const {todos, visibilityFilter} = this.props;\n    const visibleTodos = getVisibleTodos(\n      todos,\n      visibilityFilter\n    )\n    return(\n      \n        {/*  */}\n        {/* ... */}\n        \n          {visibleTodos.map(\n            /* ... */\n          )}\n        \n        {/* ... */}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst render = () => {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n    , // 用展开运算符把所有 state (todos, visibilityFilter) 传入\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  );\n};\n我们通过从 render 方法传入所有 state 把 visibilityFilter 通过 props 传递给 TodoApp.然后计算出可视的 todo 列表。最后我们只把可视列表 visibleTodos 渲染出来。现在，点击过滤器已经可以有过滤可见 todo 的效果了。但是我们不能知道当前的过滤器是哪一个，我们可以来修复这个问题。为了让过滤器组件们知道当前的过滤器是哪一个，我们应该把 visibilityFilter 传给每一个 FilterLink 组件。然后通过在 FilterLink 组件内判断是否过滤器来修改其样式。我们只要简单地将当前过滤器显示为不可点击的普通的文字就可以很好地区分了。class TodoApp extends Component {\n  // ...\n  \n  //...\n}\nconst FilterLink = ({\n  filter,\n  currentFilter,\n  children\n}) => {\n  if (filter === currentFilter) {\n    return {children};\n  }\n  return (\n    //...\n  );\n};\n总结就像之前实现计数器一样，我们应用前面学到的 Redux 知识配合 React 完成了一个完整的 Todo 应用。让我们回顾一下，一个完整的 Redux 应用应该包括：reducer\n\nstorestate\n\n\naction\n通过使用 combineReducers 方法我们将两个独立的状态联合起来组成一个整体状态去管理。我们可以很方便地添加和删除状态，就像这节里面添加过滤器一样。接下来几节我们将讨论一些在使用 Redux 中常见的问题和优雅的解决方法。.markdown-section\n{\n    overflow:
